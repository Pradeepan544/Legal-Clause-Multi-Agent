# ⚖️ Legal Clause Multi-Agent System

A smart legal clause interpreter powered by **LlamaIndex**. This system uses a multi-agent architecture with `ReactAgent` to understand, evaluate, and summarize legal clauses — not just read them like plain English.

Oh, and yes — it comes with a handler so you can watch your agents think in real time. 🕵️‍♂️

## 🧠 What It Does

This project brings together multiple agents to collaboratively process legal documents. With the power of LLMs and structured orchestration via `ReactAgent`, each clause is:

- Interpreted in a **legal context**
- Evaluated for its purpose and scope
- Summarized into human-understandable form

It’s like having a mini legal team in your terminal.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- 🧩 **LlamaIndex** – framework for managing data + LLM interactions  
- 🔁 **ReactAgent** – multi-agent coordination loop  
- 🧪 **Custom Handlers** – observe every agent's thoughts  
- 🐍 **Python** – backend brainpower  
- 🌐 (Optional) **Streamlit or Flask** – for UI if needed

## 📦 Project Structure



---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/legal-clause-agent.git
cd legal-clause-agent

---

##  🧪 Behind the Scenes
- Agents communicate via ReactAgent to delegate tasks.

- A custom Handler logs every thought, decision, and failure point.

- LLMs are directed to interpret legal meaning, not default English.

- Every run is traceable and debuggable via the handler.

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
- Don’t assume the LLM knows your domain — tell it.

 - “Clause” to you may mean legal — to an LLM, it might mean grammar.

 - You can build amazing agents… and forget the query. Don’t do that. 😉
